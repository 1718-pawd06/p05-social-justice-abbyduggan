	    	<h1>About</h1>
	    	<p>This organization was founded in the fall of 2005 by 12 members of the Energy and Environment Program, 
	    	wanting to build grassroots movements to protect resources such as food and water.The Food and Water Watch's mission 
	    	is to provide <b>clean water, food, and sustainable energy.</b> Food and Water Watch fights against businesses that place
	    	profits over people; they argue for a democracy that advocates for people's lives and our environment.</p>

	    	<h2>Corruption</h2>
	    	<p>Food and Water Watch focuses on the reasons why clean water and food isn't available for all:corruption. 
	    	For example, companies use pollution trading, a process by which they swap credits with other polluters to appear as if they 
	    	have a different pollution output than they actually do. It allows companies to not only lie about the waste they put
	    	into our food and water systems, but also never be held accountable for it. Food and Water Watch also tackles the issue of
	    	GMOs, Fracking, Global Trade, and Factory Farming and Food Safety. For more information, visit their website at:
